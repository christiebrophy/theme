	 I've spent the past four years building websites, writing about design, photographing interiors, and pitching ideas or partnerships within the interior design industry. I've been lucky to learn about vintage furniture from dealers who've been in the business for decades and for the chance to work with some of the indsutry's most creative at Lonny Magazine. I'm also a DIY lover, vintage addict, and emotional decorator.<br><br>

	 I feel most alive when creating, whether it's decorating, sewing or coding, and it's the reason my own home will never be finished. It's also the reason I decided to become a freelance web developer in order to help other innovators bring their ideas and style to life online.

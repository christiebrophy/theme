	 I've spent the past four years building websites, writing about design, photographing interiors, and pitching ideas or partnerships within the interior design industry. I've been lucky to learn about vintage furniture from dealers who've been in the business for decades and I've had the chance to work with some of the industry's most creative at Lonny Magazine.<br><br>

	 I feel most alive when creating, whether it's decorating, sewing, or coding, and it's the reason I decided to become a freelance web developer. I wake up every day excited to help other innovators bring their ideas and style to life on the web. I'm a full-stack developer, which means I have experience working on the back-end and front-end. Setting up servers and cloud hosting, working with databases and APIs, building web scrapers, and creating user interfaces are all areas I have experience in.
